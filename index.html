        <h1>My mentorship goal was to learn front-end development. Since the start of the program, I had extended my goal to include back-end development as well.<br>
          While it will take some time to learn both, it was definitely something I discussed with my mentor</h1>
        <h1>Although I obviously wasn't able to learn all things front-end nor back-end development within 6 months, I feel that I still learned a lot during that time; <br>
          such as skills and tricks that I otherwise may not have learned on my own. </h1>
        <h1>Some things that I learned include how to view developer's source code and use it for locating errors, <br>
          how to collaborate on coding via the github application, how to use the github command line, and much more.</h1>
