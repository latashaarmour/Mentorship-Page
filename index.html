      <h1>My mentorship goal was to learn front-end development. Since the start of the program, I had extended my goal to include back end development as well.<br>
        While it will take some time to learn both, it was definitely something I discussed with my mentor</br></h1>
      <h1>Although I obviously wasn't able to learn all things front-end nor back-end development, I feel that I learned a lot from Amanda; <br>
        especially certainly skills and tricks that I otherwise may not have learned on my own. </h1>
      <h1>Some things that I learned include how to view developer's source code and use it for locating errors, <br>
        how to collaborate on coding via the github application, how to use the github command line, and much more.</h1>
